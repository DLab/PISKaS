#In this example, each A has three sites which can be activated or not. 
#A configuration can be seen as the vertice of a cube, put the movement between  these vertices are constrained. 

#The observable can be triggered by activating x, then z. 
#Or by activating y, then activating x, then activating z, then desactivating x, then deactivating y, then activating x. 

#Both ways are compressed in the same causal flow.
